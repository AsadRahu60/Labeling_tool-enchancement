# Changes Made to the LabelMe Project

## Overview
The following document outlines the major enhancements, bug fixes, and integrations implemented into the LabelMe project to support video annotation, tracking, and re-identification.

---

## Enhancements

### 1. Integration of IDManager Class
- Ensured track IDs are sequential and reused.
- Resolved issues of skipping IDs in the tracking process.
- Introduced methods:
  - `get_new_id`: Fetches a unique ID, reusing released ones.
  - `release_id`: Releases unused IDs for recycling.

### 2. Annotate Video Enhancements
- Integrated YOLO, FastReID, and DeepSORT tracking.
- Enhanced logic for handling:
  - Bounding box validation.
  - Feature vector size validation.
- Added support for:
  - Unique color assignment for each track ID.
  - Annotating frames with bounding boxes, IDs, and labels.
  - Releasing unused track IDs to avoid skipping.

### 3. Improved Label Management
- Enhanced `LabelListWidget` and `UniqueLabelQListWidget`:
  - Dynamically update label lists with IDs and colors.
  - Ensured no duplicate labels.

### 4. Error Handling
- Added error checks for:
  - Feature vector sizes (e.g., expected embedding size: 2048).
  - Invalid bounding boxes.
  - Tracker update failures.

## Key Changes in `app.py`
1. Added the `IDManager` class to manage track IDs.
2. Updated `annotateVideo` method to:
   - Integrate IDManager for consistent ID handling.
   - Annotate frames with unique colors and labels.
   - Save annotations as JSON.
3. Enhanced logic to release IDs for unconfirmed or inactive tracks.

## Error Tracking
All encountered errors and their resolutions are documented in the `error.txt` file.

## Integration Notes
- Ensure the following libraries are installed:
  - `torch`
  - `cv2`
  - `qtpy`
- Verify that YOLO and FastReID models are preloaded and accessible.
